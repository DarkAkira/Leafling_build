# Leafling_build
App written in python to help in equip builds for the game Leafling. 

A .rar has been added which contains the program as an executable. To run it you'll have to extract the folders and inside leafling_build look for the application (which has the leafling logo). Carefull that most Anti-virus will trigger to this file and remove it to quarentine since it is an unknown script :S either way the code is the same as in the .py file.


Currently in the app:
  - Stats for Classes and Mythical Weapons, Armors, Off-hands, Accessories, Souls, Prefixes and Sufixes.

In Construction: 
  - Skill damage calculation bar. (Only dmg skills of sniper and warlord inserted yet.) 
  - Hover panels in the skill icon, showing it's description.

Future Adds:
  - Damage reduction percentages (based on defense and resist). 
  - Damage calculation. 
  - Class buffs being passed to the stats info.


A special thanks to all the Twelfth Surveying Artemian Regiment clan discord for their help in this project.
